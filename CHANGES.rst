1.16
====


- Introduce architectural layers and start moving the implementation
  accordingly:

  - The presentation layer contains all user interface specific implementation.
    This includes all Pyramid specific logic. Presentation uses the business
    layer for retrieving information and processing it.

    the logic on how to store the data or how to present it. Business uses the
    data layer for retrieving data and storing it.

  - The data layer's purpose is to retrieve and store data and provide an

  validate user input. They are therefore part of the presentation layer.

  the existing version 1.10.0 seems reasonable.
