"""
This module has functionality to invite members to C3S events like the General
Assembly and BarCamp.

- Email templates (en/de)
- Check and send email (view)
- Batch invite n members (view)

The first use was for the C3S HQ inauguration party in February 2014.

It was then reused for:

- BarCamp and General Assembly 2014
- BarCamp and General Assembly 2015
- BarCamp and General Assembly 2016
- BarCamp and General Assembly 2017

How it works
------------

We send an email to the members from our membership database -- this app. The
templates for those emails (english/german depending on members locale) can be
prepared here.

For convenience, staff can invite n members at the same time.

Combination with c3sPartyTicketing
----------------------------------

Invitation emails are usually prepped with links to the C3S ticketing system
(*c3sPartyTicketing*). That other webapp can be configured to fetch information
about the relevant C3S member from this app via API call, see the relevant
module.
