    Specifies the interface of a python callable for successful form

    A common usage of this callback is to perform a redirect using an HTTPFound
    Pyramid exception based on the form's data.

        class SomeRouteRedirect(IFormValidationEvent):

        def some_route_redirect(request, result, appstruct):
