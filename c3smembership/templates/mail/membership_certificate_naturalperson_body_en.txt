Please review your data and simply reply to this mail if anything turns
out to be wrong.

Please take note that this membership certificate will only be available
for two weeks for via the link above. After this time, you may of course
request a certificate by e-mail.

A note on the number of acquired shares: Since a membership is only
possible with at least one share, in accordance with German cooperative
law, the number of shares will only be listed in the certificate if it is
higher than the first mandatory share. That is, if you hold 10 shares,
you should find the note in your certificate that 9 additional shares
were acquired.

Best wishes,
Your pâ‰¡p coop team
