The general assembly
====================

The general assembly 2017 of the C3S SCE will be held in Düsseldorf
in the building where we also have our office.

April 2nd, 2017: 4th statutory general assembly of the C3S SCE
                 Rochusstr. 44
                 40479 Düsseldorf [2]
                 1.00 pm - 5.00 pm
                 Accreditation from 12.00 pm
                 Admission free

Please be punctual in order to avoid delays, because the accreditation
will take some time. Of course, participation is free.

The Barcamp
===========

April 1st, 2017: Barcamp 2017 [3]
                 Rochusstr. 44
                 40479 Düsseldorf [2]
                 1.00 pm - 7.00 pm
                 Admission free


Again, we are of the opinion that on some topics there will be more
need for information and discussion than we can deal with in the general
assembly. In order to prepare the general assembly and to move up
debates, we are offering a barcamp [3], where half a day is devoted to
discussions and idea exchange in parallel time slots.
The goal is to produce short and comprehensible summaries of what
has been discussed at the barcamp.

On the following wiki page you can add to and view the topics for the
barcamp: https://wiki.c3s.cc/index.php/Themenvorschl%C3%A4ge_BarCamp2017

At the end of an exhausting and productive barcamp, everyone needs new
energy. Therefore we would be happy to have dinner with you after the
barcamp – likely at an Italian restaurant. In any case there will be
vegetarian dishes as well. Please note on registration wether you
want to attend so that we can make reservations accordingly.

Organizational issues
=====================

Participation
-------------
Participation in the general assembly is limited to members of the C3S
SCE or authorized representatives of absent members.

Authorized representatives
--------------------------------
If you are an active member and therefore entitled to vote, but unable
to participate, you may grant a power of attorney. Further information
on that will be included in the registration e-mail.

Audio recording
---------------
During the general assembly, an audio recording will be made in order to
ensure error-free minutes. The recording will not be published but
archived internally as an appendix to the minutes.

Those who do not wish their speech contributions to be recorded, may
veto before commencing to speak.


Why is it important that you participate?
=========================================

At the barcamp, you will be able to make detailed contributions to the
discussions of the current topics and talk to the core team of the C3S.
The general assembly is the body that takes the fundamental decisions
for the C3S. (You are the general assembly, together with the other
members.)

That's all! Please let us know your proposals for topics, plan your
trip - and we'll meet in Düsseldorf in April! If you have questions,
you can get in touch, as always, via info@c3s.cc.

We look forward to you and your ideas!
