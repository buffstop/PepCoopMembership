Hello {salutation},

On April 2nd, 2017, the 4. regular general assembly of the C3S has
extended the temporary membership contribution rules, in order to secure 
the financial basis for the continuation of our common project:

  https://archive.c3s.cc/aktuell/legal/C3S_SCE_membership_dues_en.pdf

For 2017, the membership dues for active members will therefore be 50
Euro.

Since {legal_entity_name} is an investing member, you are exempt from this
payment.
However, your voluntary contribution would be highly appreciated as a
tremendous help for the C3S.

For legal entities there is a recommendation to exceed the basic fee by
adding a supportive contribution of the following amount:

a) up to a yearly turnover of 100.000 Euro: 100 Euro per year
b) up to a yearly turnover of 200.000 Euro: 200 Euro per year
c) with higher turnover: raise fee accordingly.

If you want to support us, please transfer your voluntary contribution
to the following account:

  Purpose: C3S-FZ-{membership_number}
  IBAN: DE79 8309 4495 0003 2643 78
  BIC: GENODEF1ETK
  Bank: Ethikbank

Many thanks for your support!

Your C3S team
