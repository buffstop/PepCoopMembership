Hello {salutation},

On April 17th, 2016, the 3. regular general assembly of the C3S has
extended the temporary membership contribution rules, in order to secure 
the financial basis for the continuation of our common project:

  https://archive.c3s.cc/aktuell/legal/C3S_SCE_membership_dues_en.pdf

For 2016, the membership dues for active members will therefore be 50
Euro.

Since you are an investing member, you are exempt from this payment.
However, your voluntary contribution would be highly appreciated as a
tremendous help for the C3S.

If you want to support us, please transfer your voluntary contribution
to the following account:

  Purpose: C3S-FZ-{membership_number}
  IBAN: DE79 8309 4495 0003 2643 78
  BIC: GENODEF1ETK
  Bank: Ethikbank

Many thanks for your support!

Your C3S team
