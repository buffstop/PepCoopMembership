Hello {salutation},

On July 16th, 2015, the extraordinary general assembly of the C3S has
issued temporary membership contribution rules, in order to secure the
financial basis for the continuation of our common project:

  https://archive.c3s.cc/aktuell/legal/C3S_SCE_membership_dues_en.pdf

For 2015, the membership dues for active members will therefore be 50
Euro.

Since {legal_entity_name} is an investing member, you are exempt from this
payment.
However, your voluntary contribution would be highly appreciated as a
tremendous help for the C3S.

For legal entities there is a recommendation to exceed the basic fee by
adding a supportive contribution of the following amount:

a) up to a yearly turnover of 100.000 Euro: 100 Euro per year
b) up to a yearly turnover of 200.000 Euro: 200 Euro per year
c) with higher turnover: raise fee accordingly.

If you want to support us, please transfer your voluntary contribution
to the following account:

  Purpose: C3S-FZ-{membership_number}
  IBAN: DE79 8309 4495 0003 2643 78
  BIC: GENODEF1ETK
  Bank: Ethikbank

Many thanks for your support!

Your C3S team
