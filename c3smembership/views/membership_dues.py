This module holds code for Membership Dues (2015 edition).

* Send email to a member:

   - request transferral of membership dues.
   - also send link to invoice PDF.

* Produce an invoice PDF when member clicks her invoice link.
* Batch-send email to n members.
* When dues transfer arrives, book it to member.
* When member asks for reduction of dues fee, let staff handle it:

   - set a new reduced amount
   - send email with update: reversal invoice and new invoice
